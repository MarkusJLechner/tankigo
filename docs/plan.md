# Wanki Project Improvement Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the Wanki project, an unofficial JavaScript port of the Anki spaced repetition flashcard system. The plan is based on an analysis of the current codebase, project goals, and identified constraints. It aims to guide future development efforts to enhance functionality, user experience, and maintainability.

## Project Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Create a fully functional web-based alternative to Anki** that works offline
2. **Maintain compatibility with existing Anki decks** to leverage the extensive community content
3. **Provide a consistent cross-platform experience** that works on any device with a modern browser
4. **Implement a Progressive Web App (PWA)** for offline use and installation on devices
5. **Support both light and dark modes** for better user experience in different environments

### Secondary Goals
1. **Develop a seamless review experience** directly in the browser
2. **Implement modern JavaScript features** for better performance and maintainability
3. **Enable future synchronization capabilities** across devices
4. **Support internationalization** for global accessibility
5. **Create a foundation for add-on support** to extend functionality

## Current State Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Solid technical foundation** using Vue 3, Vite, and TypeScript
2. **Well-structured database model** using Dexie.js that mirrors Anki's data structure
3. **PWA implementation** for offline capabilities
4. **Dark/light mode support** already implemented
5. **Import functionality** for existing Anki decks

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Incomplete core review functionality** needed for basic flashcard operations
2. **Missing card editor and management features** essential for creating and modifying content
3. **Lack of statistics and progress tracking** important for spaced repetition effectiveness
4. **Absence of synchronization capabilities** for multi-device usage
5. **Limited user interface for deck management** and organization
6. **No internationalization support** limiting global accessibility

## Technical Constraints

1. **Browser compatibility requirements** for cross-platform functionality
2. **IndexedDB storage limitations** for large media collections
3. **Offline-first architecture** requiring careful state management
4. **Compatibility with Anki file format** for importing and exporting
5. **Performance considerations** for handling large decks and complex card types

## Conclusion

The Wanki project has a solid foundation but requires significant development to reach feature parity with the original Anki application. This improvement plan provides a structured approach to enhancing the application while maintaining its core strengths of offline capability, cross-platform compatibility, and modern web technologies.

By following this plan, the project can systematically address current limitations while building toward a fully-featured alternative to Anki that leverages the advantages of web technologies. The phased approach allows for incremental improvements that can be tested and refined before moving on to more advanced features.
