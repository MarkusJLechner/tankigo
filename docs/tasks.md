# Wanki Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the Wanki project. Each task is logically ordered and covers both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Database and Data Management

- [ ] 1. Add unit tests for the wankidb functionality to ensure data integrity and reliability
- [ ] 2. Complete the database synchronization functionality (uncomment and fix the code in src/plugins/wankidb/db.ts)
- [ ] 3. Move type definitions from db.ts to types.ts for better organization
- [ ] 4. Refactor the set function in db.ts for better readability and maintainability
- [ ] 5. Implement proper error handling for database operations
- [ ] 6. Add data migration utilities for future schema changes
- [ ] 7. Create a comprehensive database documentation

## Code Quality and Type Safety

- [ ] 8. Replace any types with proper type definitions throughout the codebase
- [ ] 9. Fix type assertions (e.g., as T[typeof column]) with proper type guards
- [ ] 10. Remove commented-out code (e.g., in main.ts and db.ts)
- [ ] 11. Standardize error handling across the application
- [ ] 12. Implement stricter TypeScript configuration (e.g., enable strictNullChecks)
- [ ] 13. Add JSDoc comments to functions and classes for better documentation
- [ ] 14. Fix the type casting of store to Plugin in main.ts

## Testing

- [ ] 15. Increase test coverage for core functionality (plugins, store, etc.)
- [ ] 16. Add integration tests for critical user flows
- [ ] 17. Enhance component tests to cover edge cases and complex interactions
- [ ] 18. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- [ ] 19. Set up continuous integration for automated testing
- [ ] 20. Add performance tests for critical operations

## Architecture and Design

- [ ] 21. Refactor global state management to use Pinia instead of Vuex (which is deprecated for Vue 3)
- [ ] 22. Remove global window.wanki object and use proper dependency injection
- [ ] 23. Implement a proper service layer to separate business logic from components
- [ ] 24. Create a consistent error handling strategy across the application
- [ ] 25. Improve the organization of plugins directory
- [ ] 26. Implement proper lazy loading for routes to improve initial load time

## User Experience and Performance

- [ ] 27. Complete the PWA implementation (fix the commented-out code in main.ts)
- [ ] 28. Optimize bundle size by code splitting and lazy loading
- [ ] 29. Implement proper loading states for asynchronous operations
- [ ] 30. Add offline support for critical functionality
- [ ] 31. Improve error messages and user feedback
- [ ] 32. Implement performance monitoring
- [ ] 33. Optimize database queries for better performance

## Build and Deployment

- [ ] 34. Set up continuous deployment pipeline
- [ ] 35. Implement environment-specific configuration
- [ ] 36. Add build optimization for production
- [ ] 37. Implement proper versioning strategy
- [ ] 38. Add automated dependency updates with security checks
- [ ] 39. Implement proper logging for production debugging

## Documentation

- [ ] 40. Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] 41. Add inline code documentation for complex logic
- [ ] 42. Create user documentation for the application
- [ ] 43. Document the database schema and relationships
- [ ] 44. Create a contributing guide for new developers
- [ ] 45. Document the testing strategy and approach

## Security

- [ ] 46. Implement proper authentication and authorization for sync server
- [ ] 47. Add security headers to the application
- [ ] 48. Implement proper data validation for user inputs
- [ ] 49. Conduct a security audit of dependencies
- [ ] 50. Implement proper CORS configuration for the sync server
